# Lab 1 — Small Office Network with DHCP and DNS

### Objective
Simulate a small office environment where PCs receive IP addresses automatically from a DHCP router and resolve names using a DNS server.

### Tools
- Cisco Packet Tracer 8.2
- Basic Cisco IOS configuration

### Key Configurations
- Router: DHCP pool for 192.168.10.0/24
- DNS Server: `server.local` → 192.168.10.10
- PCs: auto IP + name resolution test

### Verification
- All clients successfully received IPs.
- `ping server.local` resolved via DNS.
- Network topology stable and scalable.

### Reflection
This lab helped me understand how DHCP simplifies host configuration and why DNS is critical for service discovery — especially in cloud systems where IPs often change dynamically.
