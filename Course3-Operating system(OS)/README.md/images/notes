Creating, Modifying, and Removing File & Folder Permissions in Windows

Google IT Support Professional Certificate – Course 3 Lab

📌 Overview

This lab focused on managing file and folder permissions in Windows using graphical tools and the command line. I practiced identifying effective permissions, modifying ACLs, and troubleshooting access issues — core tasks for IT Support, SysAdmin, and Security Operations roles.

🎯 Objectives

By the end of this lab, I was able to:

View and interpret NTFS permissions

Modify user and group access rights

Create and assign new permissions

Remove or deny permissions when needed

Use RDP to access the lab environment


Tools & Technologies

Windows Server (RDP session)  --rustdesk(you can use) you can also use on phone

File Explorer Security tab

NTFS permissions--

Command line basics

 What I Did in This Lab
 Connected to the Windows VM

I accessed the remote environment using the credentials provided and verified network connectivity.

 Explored NTFS Permissions

I inspected the default ACLs on sample folders, focusing on:

Full Control

Modify

Read & Execute

Special Permissions

 Created and Modified User Permissions

I added permissions for specific users, granting them read-only or modify access depending on the task.

 Removed or Denied Permissions

Tested how “Deny” overrides “Allow,” and verified effective access by re-logging into the session.

Verified Inheritance Rules

I explored how child folders inherit permissions unless inheritance is explicitly disabled.

Key Takeaways

“Deny” permissions override “Allow,” and must be used carefully.

Understanding effective permissions prevents access issues and security gaps.

IT Support roles rely heavily on identifying, modifying, and troubleshooting permission errors.

 Troubleshooting I Performed

Tested access using two different accounts

Tried opening restricted folders to validate permissions

Identified missing inheritance causing unexpected access denial



🚀 How This Lab Connects to My Career Goals

This exercise builds foundational skills for:

IT Support Analyst

System Administrator

Active Directory & Windows Server roles

Future DevOps and Cloud Admin work (IAM concepts start here)

Database engineering (because DB permissions follow the same principles)
