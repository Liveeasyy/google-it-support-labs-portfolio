## 🎯 Portfolio Vision

This repository shows my journey from IT support to **Cloud &  & Database Engineering** — connecting fundamentals like networking, Linux, and scripting with real-world automation and DevOps practices.

**Focus Areas**
- Network simulation and troubleshooting (Packet Tracer)
- Systems administration (VirtualBox & Linux) (coming soon)
- Database management (MySQL, SQL, backups)
- Cloud fundamentals (GCP, Azure)
- Automation and monitoring (Bash, Python, Terraform  coming soon)

---

## 🧠 Reflection
 These labs are more than exercises — they’re how I test, break, and rebuild systems until they make sense from the inside out.

---

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies
- Cisco Packet Tracer  
- VirtualBox (for later labs)  
- MySQL  
- Git & GitHub  
- Linux (Ubuntu Server)  
- Cloud: Google Cloud Platform (GCP), Azure
