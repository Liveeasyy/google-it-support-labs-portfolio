Overview

This lab focused on managing file and folder permissions in Windows using graphical tools and the command line. I practiced identifying effective permissions, modifying ACLs, and troubleshooting access issues — core tasks for IT Support, SysAdmin, and Security Operations roles.

 Objectives

By the end of this lab, I was able to:

View and interpret NTFS permissions

Modify user and group access rights

Create and assign new permissions

Remove or deny permissions when needed

Use RDP to access the lab environment

Understand inheritance and effective permissions

 Tools & Technologies

Windows Server (RDP session)

File Explorer Security tab

NTFS permissions

ACL Management

Command line basics

Google Skills Boost Lab Environment

🧪 What I Did in This Lab
1️⃣ Connected to the Windows VM

I accessed the remote environment using the credentials provided and verified network connectivity.

2️⃣ Explored NTFS Permissions

I inspected the default ACLs on sample folders, focusing on:

Full Control

Modify

Read & Execute

Special Permissions

3️⃣ Created and Modified User Permissions

I added permissions for specific users, granting them read-only or modify access depending on the task.

4️⃣ Removed or Denied Permissions

Tested how “Deny” overrides “Allow,” and verified effective access by re-logging into the session.

🧠 Key Takeaways

NTFS permissions are hierarchical and inheritance plays a major role.

“Deny” permissions override “Allow,” and must be used carefully.

Understanding effective permissions prevents access issues and security gaps.

IT Support roles rely heavily on identifying, modifying, and troubleshooting permission errors.

🧩 Troubleshooting I Performed

Tested access using two different accounts

Tried opening restricted folders to validate permissions

Identified missing inheritance causing unexpected access denial

This section shows employers that you troubleshoot on your own  keep it.

🚀 How This Lab Connects to My Career Goals

This exercise builds foundational skills for:

IT Support Analyst

System Administrator

Active Directory & Windows Server roles

Future DevOps and Cloud Admin work (IAM concepts start here)

Database engineering (because DB permissions follow the same principles)
